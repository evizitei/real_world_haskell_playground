An attempt at haskell, like everyone makes once in a while.

## SETUP

https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/#

`curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get-ghcup.haskell.org | sh`

## Run

you can use `make compile` to build any binaries, and run them from ./bin/thing

You can also use the library files from the ghci.

`ghci`

then import the library of choice:

`ghci> :l baby`
